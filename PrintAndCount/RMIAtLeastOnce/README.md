For this exercise, we need the server to fail ocasionally. We will introduce a 50% chance of the server throwing an exception in order to simulate the occasional failure. This will cause the the client re-try the request everytime it receives a failure. Since the RMI framework throws an exception when the connection is refused, the client will also send the request again if the server is down. The only case not covered by this code would be if the server hangs the call and never finishes executing, which appears to be outside the scope of this exercise. This case notwithstanding, the client will not stop sending the message until it receives a confirmation from the server.
