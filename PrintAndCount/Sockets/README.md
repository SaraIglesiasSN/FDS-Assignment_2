## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Code Explanation

The code is a simple example of a client-server communication using sockets in Java. The server provides a method called countLetters which takes a String parameter and returns an integer representing the number of letters in the string. The server listens on port 8888 for incoming client connections.

The server code works as follows:

The main method initializes a ServerSocket on port 8888 and enters an infinite loop.
When a client connects to the server, a new Socket object is created to represent the connection.
The BufferedReader object is created to read the incoming message from the client.
The PrintWriter object is created to send the response back to the client.
The server reads the incoming message from the client using in.readLine().
The server passes the received message to the countLetters method to count the letters in the message and returns the count.
The server sends the count back to the client using out.println(count).
The server closes the socket and the loop continues to listen for new client connections.

The client code works as follows:

The main method creates a new Socket object and connects to the server at localhost and port 8888.
The BufferedReader object is created to read the response from the server.
The PrintWriter object is created to send the message to the server.
The client sends a test message to the server using out.println(message).
The client reads the response from the server using in.readLine() and parses it to an integer.
The client prints the count received from the server to the console.
The client closes the socket.
Overall, this code shows how to implement a basic client-server communication using sockets in Java. The server listens for incoming client connections and processes the client requests by executing a server method and returning a response. The client sends a request to the server and waits for the response.
