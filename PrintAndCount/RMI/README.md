When the client executes the printAndCountLetters method on the server with the message "Hello World!", the server will print the message on its console and return the number of letters (10) back to the client. Note that the printAndCountLetters method passes the message as a parameter, as there is no need to pass the StringBuffer object between the client and the server, since parameters are passed by value, not by reference.
## Explanation
RemoteBuffer.java:

This file contains the definition of the RemoteBuffer interface. It extends the Remote interface and declares the printAndCountLetters method, which can be invoked remotely. This method throws a RemoteException in case of any remote communication error.

StringServer.java:

This file contains the implementation of the RemoteBuffer interface. It extends the UnicastRemoteObject class, which provides a default implementation for the Remote interface. The StringServer class contains a private StringBuffer instance variable that stores the string to be processed. The class provides the implementation of the printAndCountLetters method, which counts the number of letters in the message by iterating over each character in the message and by using the Character.isLetter() method, it checks whether it is a letter. In addition, it has a main method that creates an instance of the StringServer class and binds it to a name in the RMI registry.

StringClient.java:

This file contains the client code that invokes the remote methods on the StringServer object. It looks up the RemoteBuffer object in the RMI registry, and invokes the printAndCountLetters method of the RemoteBuffer interface.

---

In summary, RemoteBuffer.java defines the interface for the remote methods, StringServer.java implements the method of the interface and binds it to the RMI registry, and StringClient.java uses the RMI registry to look up the RemoteBuffer object and invoke its methods.
